# Fusers

Fusers is a WIP tower defense game designed for PC and IOS. Fusers incorporates a leveling system similar to those found in RPG's. Towers can be leveled up by investing into them with Cores. As a tower levels up it can specialize into one of the four elemental types, Fire, Wind, Earth, and Water. After choosing an element type the towers can invest in differnet skills available for that element, and they can eventually expand to include an additional elemental type allowing for more customization and exciting combinations.
